    "## Case Background\n",
    "As a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic (a bike-sharing company active in Chicago), I am tasked with understanding how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Casual riders consist of customers that purchase single-ride or full-day passes, whereas annual members subscribe yearly for unlimited biking access. The marketing director theorizes that the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of yearly memberships by converting casual riders into annual members. Pending executive approval, my team will be designing a new marketing strategy that pursues this idea. \n",

    "To inform any decision-making behind Cyclistic's new marketing strategy, the goal of this project will be to uncover and convey actionable insights.\n",
